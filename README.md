osu! API v2 Wrapper Written in Go

There are no docs since this was initially planned to be used in another project and wasn't supposed to be a standalone client.

The wrapper uses reflection and struct tags on options for incredibly easy endpoint definition. Clone and use if you want.

Docs and convert to proper package maybe later.
